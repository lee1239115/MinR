At Purdue IE, we’re actively involved in finding ways to overcome today’s societal grand challenges. We are advancing engineering learning, discovery, and engagement through our revolutionary “ReThink IE” initiative to have a continuous transformative impact on the IE discipline and society.

Learn about our “ReThink IE” initiative. Reflect on our History and see how our "re-imagined" Facilities are helping us break new ground in industrial engineering. Watch some of our past Lectures and Seminars that honor those who’ve shaped us. Read our News and Events. Get involved and follow us on social media! Come visit us – and contact us to share your thoughts on how you think we can better "Rethink IE".
